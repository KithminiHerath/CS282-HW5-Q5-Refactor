# CS282-HW5-Q5-Refactor

This is a refactored version of the "Understanding Dropout" coding problem in the CS182/282 Homework 5.

## Overview

This assignment was designed to analyze the effect of dropout in a simplified setting. As you navigate through this assignment you will understand how to implement dropout from scratch and analyze its capacity to improve generalization by preventing models from learning spurious "cheating" correlations in the training data.

## Getting Started

This code is currently setup to run on Google Collab.
